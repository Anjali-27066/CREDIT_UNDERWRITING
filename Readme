AI Credit Underwriting System
This Streamlit-based web application simulates an AI-powered Credit Underwriting System for evaluating loan applications. It allows users to input personal and financial details, upload documents for OCR processing, and receive instant loan approval decisions using rule-based predictions.

ðŸš€ Features
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Step Loan Application Process
Personal Information: Collects basic applicant data like name, email, income, etc.

Loan Details: Captures CIBIL score, loan amount, interest, employment details.

Document Uploads: Supports PDF/image uploads (Aadhar, PAN, Salary Slip) and extracts data using OCR.

Final Decision: Uses custom underwriting logic to approve/reject loans with simulated email feedback.

ðŸ”¹ Embedded Chatbot
A sidebar chatbot that answers queries about:

Loan types

EMI calculations

Credit scores

Financial advice

ðŸ”¹ EMI Calculator
Calculates monthly installments based on user inputs (loan amount, interest rate, tenure).

ðŸ”¹ OCR with Tesseract & Poppler
Extracts text from uploaded documents (PDFs/images).

Uses pytesseract and pdf2image for seamless text extraction.

ðŸ§  Prediction Logic
A dummy credit scoring model is used, which approves loans based on:

CIBIL Score â‰¥ 700

Loan-to-income ratio < 70%

This can easily be replaced with a real ML model for production use.
